There are two rival teams whose objective is to hit a small puck across the ice and into the goalposts. Although each team can have up to 20 players, only six players can be on the ice at one time. This means that substitutes are changed quite regularly throughout the game, which lasts 60 minutes. There are three 20-minute time slots and a 15-minute half-time period. Every time a team lands the puck in the goalpost, the team that scores is awarded a point. To play the game, the puck is passed strategically between the team’s players along the ice and to the rival team’s goals.

Heavyweights, like Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali, are often considered to be the world’s best and most impressive boxers. If you’re looking for some great <b>boxing betting predictions</b>, look no further than at some of the best-ranked boxers from around the globe.</p>\n <p>Currently, the world’s best-ranked boxers are Saul Alvarez, middleweight, with a recorded 53 wins (36 by knockout), Vasyl Lomachenko, a Lightweight, with 14 wins (10 by knockout), Naoya Inoue, a Bantamweight, with 19 wins (16 by knockout), Errol Spence Jr. a Welterweight, with 26 wins (21 by knockout) and Tyson Fury, a Heavyweight, with 30 wins (21 by knockout).

Boxing is a highly competitive sport and has many rules and regulations in order for the fight to be considered legitimate. The boxing ring itself is a raised, square platform covered with padding. Most boxing rings are 16 feet per side, although some boxing organisations allow for up to 20 feet.</p>\n <p>The boxing match, called the fight, is divided into 2-3 minute rounds with a one-minute rest period in between. Most professional boxing matches that are a championship level are 12 rounds in total while fewer rounds are expected for lower levels.</p>\n <p>The boxers have to wear boxing gloves, which are also made from specialised padding to prevent injury. While the boxer’s ultimate goal is to knock out their opponent, which qualifies as a knock-out if the fighter cannot rise to their feet before the referee counts to ten, there are other ways to score points. Judges will decide who won each round by scoring punches, which can be quite subjective. The judges will take into account the number of punches and control of the ring in order to determine the winner. It’s the type of sports match that will keep you on your toes right up until the very last minute, so best get those <b>boxing bets</b> ready to pack a punch</p>\n <h2>How can I win on boxing bets?</h2>\n  <p>Get these expert Betika boxing betting predictions that you can use when you want to bet on boxing matches: study each fighter’s boxing history or record.

Two opposing teams use a round ball, a net and a 9 x 18-metre volleyball court to compete. Each team consists of either six players for indoor volleyball or two in beach volleyball, and the objective is to be the first team to reach 25 points. A point is awarded to the serving team when an opposing player makes a fault. A team may touch the ball a maximum of three times in a row, while individual players may touch it only once in a row or a fault occurs. A common point-scoring event occurs when the ball lands on the court on the opponent’s side.</p>\n <p>A volleyball game starts off with a serve. The ball has to land within the boundaries of the opponent’s court. The opposing players need to try and play the ball before it touches the ground to prevent the serving team from scoring a point – unless it's going out! On winning back the serve, each of the six players must rotate a position in the correct order before the serve is taken. There's no tie or draw in volleyball. If during a set, teams are level on points at 24-24, the team that can get two points ahead first wins the set. A match consists of up to five sets.</p>\n <h2>How to place volleyball bets with Betika?</h2>\n <p>There are plenty of volleyball betting choices you can make.

The player in possession of the ball may be tackled by an opponent in an attempt to win the ball. It can get pretty rough!</p>\n <p>Players score in three ways. The first is by kicking the ball through two middle posts without another player touching it – that's worth six points. The second is by kicking it between a middle and outside post for one point. Finally, if a player kicks it and it hits the middle post, that's one point.</p>\n <h2>How to place the best Aussie Rules bets with Betika?</h2>\n <p>Bettors have various options with <b>Aussie Rules</b>.

Learn the basics of this iconic game and improve your winnings from your <b>cricket bets</b>.</p>\n <p>There are three types of professional cricket matches: Test, T20, and One-day matches. The matches differ mainly in how long they last. T20 matches are the shortest while a test can actually take a full five days to complete! Popular tournaments include the Indian Premier League, World Cup, T20 World Cup, and County Championship in England. Test matches are massively popular in countries such as India, South Africa, and Australia. See if you recognise some of these names: Chris Gayle, Ben Stokes, Virat Kohli, and AB de Villiers – these are just a few of the game's biggest names. Kenya is also a member of the International Cricket Council and participates in one-off tournaments with neighbouring countries like Uganda and Nigeria. </p>\n <h2>Cricket betting tips: How is cricket played?</h2>\n <p>Understanding the details of how to play will improve your odds of winning on your <b>cricket bets</b>. A game is played between two teams of 11 players, with the aim being to score more runs than the opponents within the allocated time. A bowler throws the ball towards three sticks called stumps, and the batter will try to prevent the ball from hitting them using the bat. A batter also wants to hit the ball towards the edge of the ground so that he and his batting partner have time to make runs – but they have to make it back to the stumps before the fielders (stood around the field) can get the ball there.</p>\n <p>If the batter gets it over the boundary, the running becomes irrelevant – that's six runs if it didn't touch the ground and four if it did. If the bowler hits the stumps with the ball, the batter is out and the next batter comes in to replace him or her. The other common way to get a batter out is for the opposition fielders to catch the ball after it has been hit but before it touches the ground. When the batting team is all out or run out of time, the teams switch. Then the new batting team will try and beat their score. And of course, the bowlers want to stop that!</p>\n <h2>How to place the best cricket bets with Betika</h2>\n <p>Betika offers loads of ways for <b>online cricket betting</b>.

Dota 2 is one of the most popular eSports games in the world. Its championship, The International, carries the largest eSports payout in the world. Why is Dota 2 so popular?

The <b>baseball betting odds</b> usually point in favour of the preferred players, but you could win more money if you back the underdog.</p>\n <p>Here are a few more top <b>baseball betting tips</b> from our experts at Betika:</p>\n <p><b>Bet based on stats</b></br>Make sure the team you back is statistically doing well. By going for a team based on crowd appeal and emotion, you won’t be making a fully informed choice.</p>\n <p><b>Consider the umpire</b></br> The umpire of a game plays a more significant role than you may realise. This person is also human and prone to biases whether they realise it or not. If you check umpire runs, you will be able to see if your favoured team typically wins or loses under their watch.</p>\n <p><b>Watch the weather</b></br>As primarily an outdoor sport, weather can play a prominent role in a team’s performance. Wind and rain will impact player performance. The pitch will be more slippery when it rains, and visibility drops by nearly 50%. Wind can also blow the ball off course.</p>\n <h2>Sign up with Betika to start placing baseball bets today</h2>\n <p>Are you ready to cash in your winnings from <b>baseball betting?</b> Fantastic!

        "content": "<p>MMA is also known as <b>Mixed Martial Arts betting</b>. It's a sport that has grown in popularity and mixes martial art styles, like Judo, Tae Kwon Do, Karate and Muay Thai. This sport will thrill you if you’re a big fan of boxing or martial arts. Learn about <b>MMA betting</b> with Betika. Get <b>MMA odds</b> and place winning <b>MMA bets</b> online on all the biggest fights of the season.</p>\n <h2>What is MMA?</h2>\n <p>MMA, also known as cage fighting, is quite a new combat-type sport, having started in the 1990s. <a href=\"https://www.mmafighting.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mixed Martial Arts</a> is a full-contact sport, which means that moves like striking, grappling, ground fighting and boxing are used to score points. The combat sport has evolved from various fighting styles into its own martial art as it has gained global popularity.</p>\n <p>MMA is managed by the UFC, or <a href=\"https://www.ufc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">'Ultimate Fighting Championship'</a>. This is the official organisation that runs and organizes MMA fights. Discover even more about <b>MMA betting</b>.</p>\n <h2>How does mixed martial arts betting work?</h2>\n <p>Mixed martial art competitors do a one-on-one battle in an octagon cage with high wire walls. The fights allow different fighting styles and techniques from all known martial art disciplines.</p>\n <p>Two fighters will compete against one another in a match that is divided into several rounds. Typically, each round is about 15-25 minutes (sometimes up to 29 minutes). There are usually three to five rounds in total. The fighter who wins the most rounds or who knocks out his opponent is declared the winner.</p>\n <p>The MMA sport has its own unique set of rules that are quite different from boxing. The main difference is the type of moves a fighter can make. Boxing only strikes blows to the opponent's head or torso, whereas with MMA, the fighters can engage with each other by using grappling techniques they’ve drawn from fighting styles like jiu-jitsu, judo and even wrestling. Elbows, kicks, and knee strikes are allowed in professional matches. This makes MMA betting very exciting!</p>\n <p>There are many different weight divisions in MMA betting. These include:</p>\n <ol><li> Strawweight (52.2kg / ll5lbs)</li><li>Flyweight  (56.7kg / 125lbs)</li><li>Bantamweight (61.2kg / 135lbs)</li><li> Featherweight (65.8kg / 145lbs)</li><li>Lightweight (70.3kg / 155lbs)</li><li> Welterweight (77.1kg / 170lbs)</li><li>Middleweight (83.9kg / 185lbs)</li><li>Light heavyweight (93kg / 205lbs)</li><li>Heavyweight (120kg / 265lbs) </li></ol>\n <h2>Be a winner: register with Betika to place MMA bets</h2>\n <p>Get the best <b>MMA betting tips</b> when you register online with Betika to set up an account, and you can place your <b>MMA bets</b> on the latest big fights, both national and international.

While the game may not be an Olympic sport currently, it still has a thriving match calendar.</p>\n <p>The <b>lawn bowls betting</b> scene has grown in popularity as well. There are many opportunities where you can place <b>lawn bowls bets</b>, with Betika being the best option for Kenyan betters.</p>\n <p>Let's discover more about the game and how to bet on tournaments worldwide. You'll be glad you looked into the game when you start earning from your bets with Betika!</p>\n <h2>About lawn bowls</h2>\n <p>The Ancient Egyptians first developed the game. The British cottoned on to it around the 13th century and have been playing it ever since. However, lawn bowling's popularity was unstable until the middle of the 19th century.</p>\n <p>The game had a revival in Scotland in the 1800s when the Scottish developed many rules that players still adhere to today. Initially, the game was <a href=\"https://www.bowls.co.uk/history\" target=\"_blank\">not as gentle</a> as it is today.</p>\n <p>Over time, the <b>lawn bowls betting</b> scene grew in popularity as well. It is now commonly practiced throughout the world</p>\n <h2>How do you play the game?</h2>\n <p>Lawn bowls, also known as lawn bowling or simply bowls, is usually played on a flat green for \"flat-green\" tournaments. The game can also take place on an uneven green for \"crown-green\" matches.</p>\n <p>Betters can choose to make <b>lawn bowls bets</b> on crown-green or flat-green games. Flat-green matches are more common, however.</p>\n <p><b>Bowling</b></br>Players must roll their ball towards a smaller ball, known as a \"kitty\" or a \"jack\". The aim is to get the bowling ball closer to the jack than the other team's ball. Players sometimes knock aside their opponents' ball or the jack</p>\n <p><b>Teams</b></br>Bowls teams can consist of two to four players. Two-person group rules allow each player to roll four balls. Three-person teams let players each roll three balls, and four-person teams roll two balls each. A singles match takes place between two players. They each must roll four balls. You can thus do <b>lawn bowls betting</b> on any of these options.</p>\n <p><b>Scoring</b></br>A team gets a point when their ball gets closer to the jack than the opponents'. Typically, whichever team gets to 21 points first wins.</p>\n <h2>Best betting tips</h2>\n <p>When considering your <b>lawn bowls betting odds</b> in <a href=\"https://www.bowlschat.com/directory/national/kenya-bowling-association\" target=\"_blank\">Kenya</a>, it helps to know how best to place a bet. The process is relatively straightforward. There is a variety of bowls competitions from which to choose. You can place <b>lawn bowls bets</b> on indoor and outdoor matches.</p>\n <p>You can select nation-based teams or individuals for your betting.</p>\n <h2>Register an account with Betika to start betting today</h2>\n <p>You can't cash in on your winnings from <b>lawn bowls betting</b> unless you are registered on Betika. So, are you ready to join the fun and start making money? Great! Then, sign up for an account to begin betting and winning today.</p>\n <p>It is super easy to sign up for your account with Betika.com.

These include immediate withdrawals and payments, among others.</p>\n <h2>About water polo as a sport</h2>\n <p>Water polo is a team sport that usually takes place in a swimming pool (30mx20m for men and 25mx17m for women). Each side has seven players. A match is divided into four eight-minute quarters, during which each team tries to score by throwing a ball into the opposition’s goal nets. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the last quarter wins the game.</p>\n <p>The discipline has been an <a href=\"https://olympics.com/en/sports/water-polo/\" target=\"_blank\">Olympic sport</a> since the 1900s. It’s a favourite spectator sport, as play can get tense and even aggressive! The sport’s action-packed nature means <b>water polo betting</b> is a massive market.</p>\n <h2>Which countries have the top water polo players?</h2>\n <p>When working out your <b>water polo betting odds</b>, it helps to know which countries do the best in the sport.

Know your teams, leagues, <a href=\"https://www.fina.org/water-polo/rankings\" target=\"_blank\">current rankings</a>, and even venues inside out. Follow your favourite teams’ most recent results to help you know how they’re performing, which will help to inform your bet.

This is the added time after 90 minutes of normal play.</li><li><strong>Live bet:</strong> This is a bet placed when the game is in-play or regular time has begun. Live bets cannot be cancelled once made.</li><li><strong>Single bet:</strong> Single bet is a bet placed on just one selection or market. When placing single bets, your return will not depend on the outcome of several matches.</li><li><strong>Multi bet:</strong> This is a bet placed on several selections or markets. When placing multibets, the return depends on the outcome of all the matches within the bet.</li><li><strong>Postponed/Cancelled Match:</strong> Postponed/cancelled games will be deemed to be games which do not get to kick off on the specified calendar date but have been scheduled to take place at a later date.<br>In the instance where a match is postponed, the bet shall become void upon notification of the postponement unless the match is rescheduled and commences within 48 hours of the original kick-off time. If a match is cancelled, stake refunds will be provided for single bets whereas for multi-bets, cancelled selections shall be treated as non-runners and settled with odds of 1.0</li><li><strong>Regular/Normal Time: </strong>This is the period of time, which includes injury time, over which a sport is played and is set out as the normal duration of play within a sport’s rules. This period does not include extra time</li><li><strong>Retired Match:</strong> When a match is incomplete as the result of one player it is considered a \"Retired\" match. For example, when one of the players in a tennis match withdraws or is disqualified</li><li><span><strong>Related Bets:</strong> These are multi bets which combine different selections within the same event. Related Bets are not accepted where the outcome of one affects or is affected by the other.<br><br><ol><li>When the related parts of a winning bet are resolved at different times but still within the same tournament, the bet(s) will be settled with the stake being divided by the number of legs, with each leg being settled individually at the confirmed price of each leg.</li><li>In the case of all multiples including selections with related outcomes, if a bet is taken inadvertently, Betika reserves the right to void part of or the whole of the bet at our sole discretion.</li></ol></span></li></ul></div>"

Where a bet is accepted erroneously if the result has already occurred, or is different from the official real time result of the governing body of a particular league or event, or after the selected participant or team has gained a material advantage, Betika reserves the right to void the bet and refund a customer’s stake accordingly. </li><li>Betika aims to ensure that all the information displayed on our site is accurate, however, such information is to be used as a guide only. Betika assumes no liability in the event of any particular information being incorrect (e.g: date, time, score, results etc.) Acknowledging that speed and accuracy are key elements to ensuring that live results/outcomes are accurate and up to date, and while every effort is expended by us to ensure that the information is updated as soon as possible, Betika will not be held liable for any delay in the upload/update of any official result(s).

The amount may vary from one Midweek Jackpot event to the next depending on the number of winner(s) in each Midweek Jackpot event.</li><li>At the end of the last match in the Midweek Jackpot list, once the correct outcomes of all the 15 matches have been determined and/or resulted, the Midweek Jackpot winner(s) will be the ones who have predicted 15/15 games correctly.</li><li>Winners shall be required to avail themselves at Betika offices with proof of identity before any payment is made during which period we will undertake due diligence on the account activity and make inquiries with mobile money service providers, the National Police Service, the Betting Control and Licensing Board, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the Financial Reporting Centre and the Unclaimed Financial Assets Authority among other relevant and competent government authorities.

Once submitted, Midweek Jackpot bets can only be cancelled within 15 minutes of placement; after this period, bets cannot be cancelled or amended.</li><li>Midweek Jackpot bets are accepted just before the scheduled kick-off of the first football match of the Midweek Jackpot.
